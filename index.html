                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        Cypress is one of the most popular end-to-end automation tools for web automation. 
                        In my opinion, the tool is easy to pick up with lots of great documentation and community support. 
                        Some of my favorite blogs for cypress support include:<br>
                        - <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/author/gleb/">Gleb Bahmutov Official Cypress.io blog</a><br>
                        - <a href="https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/tags/cypress/">Gleb Bahmutov Personal Cypress blog</a><br>
                        - <a href="https://discord.gg/wFhWsKXx7X">Cypress.io Community Official Discord Server</a><br>
                        - <a href="https://filiphric.com/blog">Filip Hric Cypress Blog</a><br><br>
                        Honestly, there are so many cypress resources available online that it helps make the tool incredibly nice to work with. 
                        I'm sure I've referenced other resources that I have neglected to mention here.

                    <h3>Project</h3>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        I have designed, developed and maintained automated test suites using Cypress before but in my opinion, 
                        it is always valuable to empty our cup and start from the beginning to demonstrate and strengthen fundamental skills. 
                        With that in mind I opted to automate a few scenarios using the website Swag Labs (saucedemo.com).
                        SauceDemo is a sample website built by SauceLabs that allows users to practice browser automation.<br><br>
                        The bulk of the project is designed around automating scenarios for SauceDemo and to that end I will focus on discussing those instead. 
                        It's also worth noting that this project is very much a work in progress, there is a lot of scope to add new scenarios in the future. 
                        Continued iteration is a healthy part of the development process and I expect I will continue to update the code and this post as time goes on.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#System-requirements">Installing Cypress</a> is 
                        pretty straight forward. I'm using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> but opted to use 
                        <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a> as the package manager versus <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>, 
                        but there isn't a good reason for that aside from comfort level.
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted an XML report to be generated after test run completed, so I could import the results into a 
                        <a href="https://www.testmo.com/">testmo</a> 
                        account via their API. Unfortunately, my trial account to testmo has expired but you may still see the remnants 
                        of the effort throughout the codebase. I felt that having the report generated was still extremely useful, 
                        so instead I save it as an artifact I can easily reference within circle-ci after a job completes. 
                        I referenced <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/7-easy-steps-to-generate-xml-and-html-reports-in-cypress">this article</a> 
                        to get the reporting stood up very easily.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Code</h3>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        After installing cypress and other dependencies (that are needed for the aforementioned reporting), 
                        it was time to get started. I prefer to keep locator values in a separate constants-like file for re-use, 
                        as well as certain verbiage such as error messaging, things like that. This page object model approach helps 
                        me and many others to keep the test scripts organized and easy to understand. See below an example of such a 
                        constant file:<br><br>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/rakazirut/cde3a5ba539aea5e325e2c2bfa3b2438.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        From there, I went ahead and added some visual, happy path, and negative scenarios around logging in for the 
                        SauceDemo webpage. This is just a demo website, so there isn't any network request after attempting to login 
                        to intercept and verify, otherwise we'd have done that where appropriate.<br><br>
                        After logging in, the user lands on the product inventory page. I began to add scenarios around this page as well, 
                        but that is still a work in progress, along with checkout scenarios, etc. Click the Github icon at the bottom of this
                        page to view the codebase.
                        <br><br> 
                        The cypress runner offers the ability to run the test suite in the command line or via GUI. You could use the command 
                        yarn cypress open or npx cypress open to open the cypress GUI, for example. You can select from the browsers versions 
                        currently installed on the host machine (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Electron). See below the login scenarios executing in 
                        the GUI for Chrome browser.<br><br>
                        <div class="blog-img">
                            <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="img-resp" src="https://robertkazirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022-05-07-11-45-33-1.gif">
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        <br>
                        Included in the codebase is a <a href="https://circleci.com/">circle-ci</a> YAML config to get the automation running 
                        in a circle-ci CI/CD pipeline on 
                        developer commits, as well as a daily build running on a scheduled cronjob. Admittedly, the config is pretty simple 
                        compared to what might be needed for the business needs, but at least gives us some building blocks to work with, as 
                        well as demonstrates the ability in principle.<br><br>
                        I have also included a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> YAML config to containerize the 
                        project. Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service 
                        products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers, and docker-compose is one 
                        flavor of accomplishing the objective of containerizing the project. Assuming docker and docker-compose are installed on 
                        the host machine, the user can simply provide the command docker-compose up cypress to create the cypress container and run 
                        the suite in isolation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="port-blog-body">
                        Today, Cypress is a popular choice for web test automation. And I certainly can see why. Installation is straight-forward, 
                        getting a framework off the ground is easy, community support is incredible and passionate, and if you're organized you can 
                        get testing scenarios stood up and ready to contribute to maintaining the quality of your application under test fairly 
                        quickly. Not to mention the excellent

                        which helps with recording test runs, getting analytics about your 
                        test performance, enabling parallel runs in CI/CD pipelines, etc.
                        <br><br>
                        Cypress is definitely my go-to for web test automation frameworks, but I'm open-minded and want to work with other options 
                        so that I can make the best decision of framework depending on the application, not personal bias. It's with that in mind 
                        that I worked to convert these scripts into playwright scripts, which I have never worked in before but was interested to 
                        see how it compares and contrasts. But I do love working with Cypress and look forward to doing more with it as my career 
                        continues.
